This is an example repo for how to use GraphQL Code Generator together with:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/)
- [Nhost](http://nhost.io/)

This repo is a reference repo for the blog post: [How to use GraphQL Code Generator with React and React Query](https://nhost.io/blog/how-to-use-graphql-code-generator-with-react-query).

## Get Started
