Nhost is the open source GraphQL backend (Firebase Alternative) and a development platform. Nhost is doing for the backend, what [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) are doing for the frontend.

We provide a modern backend with the general building blocks required to build fantastic digital products.
