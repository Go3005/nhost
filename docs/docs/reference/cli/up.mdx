Launch the development environment for your project. Once the environment is up, the command will:

- Apply database migrations.
- Apply the Hasura metadata.

```bash
nhost up
```

If it's the first time you start the project, [seed data](/database#seed-data) will be applied.

## Stop

Use `ctrl+c` to stop the development environment.
