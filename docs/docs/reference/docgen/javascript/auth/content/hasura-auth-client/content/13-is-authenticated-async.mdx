# `isAuthenticatedAsync()`

Use `nhost.auth.isAuthenticatedAsync` to wait (await) for any internal authentication network requests to finish and then return the authentication status.

The promise won't resolve until the authentication status is known.
Attention: when using auto-signin and a refresh token is present in the client storage, the promise won't resolve if the server can't be reached (e.g. offline) or if it returns an internal error.

```ts
const isAuthenticated = await nhost.auth.isAuthenticatedAsync()

if (isAuthenticated) {
  console.log('User is authenticated')
}
```
