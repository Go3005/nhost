Nhost Authentication is a ready-to-use authentication service that is integrated with the [GraphQL API](/graphql) and its permission system from Hasura.

Nhost Authentication lets you authenticate users using different sign-in methods:

- [Email and Password](/authentication/sign-in-with-email-and-password)
- [Magic Link](/authentication/sign-in-with-magic-link)
- [Phone Number (SMS)](/authentication/sign-in-with-phone-number-sms)
- [Security Keys (WebAuthn)](/authentication/sign-in-with-phone-number-sms)
- [Apple](/authentication/sign-in-with-apple)
- [Discord](/authentication/sign-in-with-discord)
- [Facebook](/authentication/sign-in-with-facebook)
- [GitHub](/authentication/sign-in-with-github)
- [Google](/authentication/sign-in-with-google)
- [LinkedIn](/authentication/sign-in-with-linkedin)
- [Spotify](/authentication/sign-in-with-spotify)
- [Twitch](/authentication/sign-in-with-twitch)

## How it works

1. When a user signs up or is created, the user's information is inserted into the `auth.users` table in your database.
2. Nhost returns an access token and a refresh token, together with the user's information.
3. The user sends requests to Nhost services (GraphQL API, Authentication, Storage, Functions) with the access token as a header.
4. The Nhost services use the user's access token to authorize the requests.

Nhost Autentication is integrated with your [database](/database). All users are stored in the `users` table in the `auth` schema.
