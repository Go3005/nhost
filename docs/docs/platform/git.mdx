Nhost allows you to automatically deploy your Nhost project when you do changes to your Git repository.

## Supported Git Providers

- GitHub

Support GitLab, BitBucket, and other Git providers are on our roadmap.

## How It Works

The following things are deployed:

- Database migrations
- Hasura metadata
- Serverless Functions

:::caution
Settings in `nhost/config.yaml` are **not** deployed. That means you need to manually sync settings between local and remote environments between the CLI and Nhost Cloud.

## Using GitHub

1. From your Nhost project, click **Connect to Github**.

2. **Install the Nhost project** on your Github account.

3. **Connect** your Github repository.

## Deployment Branch

Nhost only deploys your **deployment branch**. By default, your deployment branch matches the default branch set on GitHub (usually `main`).

You can change the deployment branch by clicking **Edit** next to the repository in your Nhost project's Overview.

You can have multiple Nhost projects connected to the same GitHub repository and use different deployment branches (e.g., `main` and `staging`).

## Base Directory

If your Nhost project is not at the root of your git repository (typically when using a monorepo), you can set a custom base directory. The base directory is where the `nhost` directory is located. In other words, the base directory is the **parent directory** of the `nhost` folder.
