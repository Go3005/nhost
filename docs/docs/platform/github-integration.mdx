The GitHub integration allows you to automatically deploy your Nhost project when on push and merge to a GitHub repository that is connected to your Nhost project.

When a GitHub repository is connected to a Nhost project, Nhost automatically deploys changes when you push code to the repo.

The following things are deployed:

- Database migrations
- Hasura metadata
- Serverless Functions

:::info
Settings in `nhost/config.yaml` are **not** deployed. That means you need to manually sync settings between local and remote environments between the CLI and Nhost Cloud.

## Connecting a GitHub repository

1. From your Nhost project, click **Connect to Github**.

2. **Install the Nhost project** on your Github account.

3. **Connect** your Github repository.

## Deployment Branch

Nhost only deploys your **deployment branch**. By default, your deployment branch matches the default branch set on GitHub (usually `main`).

You can change the deployment branch by clicking **Edit** next to the repository in your Nhost project's Overview.

You can have multiple Nhost projects connected to the same GitHub repository and use different deployment branches (e.g., `main` and `staging`).

## Base Directory

If your Nhost project is not at the root of your git repository (typically when using a monorepo), you can set a custom base directory. The base directory is where the `nhost` directory is located. In other words, the base directory is the **parent directory** of the `nhost` folder.
