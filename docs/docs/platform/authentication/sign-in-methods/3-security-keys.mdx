Follow this guide to sign in users with security keys and the WebAuthn API.

Examples of security keys:

- [Windows Hello](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/learn-about-windows-hello-and-set-it-up-dae28983-8242-bb2a-d3d1-87c9d265a5f0)
- [Apple Touch ID](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201371)
- [Apple Face ID](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208109)
- [Yubico security keys](https://www.yubico.com/)
- Android Fingerprint sensors

## Setup

Enable the Security Key sign-in method in the Nhost dashboard under **Users** -> **Authentication Settings** -> **Security Keys**.

You need to make sure you also set a valid client URL under **Users** -> **Authentication Settings** -> **Client URL**.

## Sign Up

Signing up with a security key uses the same method as signing up with an email and a password. Instead of a `password` parameter, you need to set the `securityKey` parameter to `true`:

```tsx
const { error, session } = await nhost.auth.signUp({
  email: 'joe@example.com',
  securityKey: true
})
if (error) {
  // Something unexpected happened, for instance, the user canceled their registration
  console.log(error)
} else if (session) {
  // Sign up is complete!
  console.log(session.user)
} else {
  console.log(
    'You need to verify your email address by clicking the link in the email we sent you.'
  )
}
```

## Sign In

Once a user added a security key, they can use it to sign in:

```tsx
const { error, session } = await nhost.auth.signIn({
  email,
  securityKey: true
})
if (session) {
  // User is signed in
} else {
  // Something unexpected happened
  console.log(error)
}
```

## Add a Security Key

Any signed-in user with a valid email can add a security key when the feature is enabled. For instance, someone who signed up with an email and a password can add a security key and thus use it for their later sign-in!

Users can use multiple devices to sign in to their account. They can add as many security keys as they like.

```tsx
const { key, error } = await nhost.auth.addSecurityKey()
if (key) {
  // Successfully added a new security key
  console.log(key.id)
} else {
  // Somethine unexpected happened
  console.log(error)
}
```

A nickname can be added for each security key to make them easy to identify:

```tsx
await nhost.auth.addSecurityKey('my macbook')
```

## List or Remove Security Keys

To list and to remove security keys can be achieved over GraphQL after setting the correct Hasura permissions to the `auth.security_keys` table:

```graphql
query securityKeys($userId: uuid!) {
  authUserSecurityKeys(where: { userId: { _eq: $userId } }) {
    id
    nickname
  }
}
mutation removeSecurityKey($id: uuid!) {
  deleteAuthUserSecurityKey(id: $id) {
    id
  }
}
```
